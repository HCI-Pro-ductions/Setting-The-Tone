# Setting The Tone
"Setting the Tone" is a Chrome Extention that helps to identify sarcasm in text, mainly in social media posts, to help the neurodivergent. <br>
This is still a work in progress. <br>

The url link to the server that has the ai to determine the tones that the Chrome extention uses can be found here: <br>

http://34.97.97.204/Setting-The-Tone/NegNeuPosTester.php?sentence=test (/neg /neu /pos) <br>

For tone detection with a simple UI: http://34.97.97.204/Setting-The-Tone/test.php

One of the training dataset was too huge for GitHub, so find it here instead: https://files.monster-melancholy.me/pw/
